Objective: Creating a Customer Churn Prediction model and gain insights through Customer Segmentation on the data.

This is the final model that we created using 
1. Logistic Regression - 86.4% Accuracy
2. Random Forest Classifier - 99.85% Accuracy

I have performed Exploratory Data Analysis to know the relationship between different Features. We have used a Correlation Matrix.

One Hot and Ordinary Label Encocding has been used to convert Categorical Features to Numerical.

Found 4 Clusters of Customers with different Income, Investment and Expense Classes.
